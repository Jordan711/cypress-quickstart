# Cypress Test Structure

Let's go to `cypress\e2e\1-getting-started\todo.cy.js` and  open the `todo.cy.js` file in a code editor (Any is fine, but I recommend VS Code).

This file doesn't include any import statements by default, but in a typical project, you would add your imports at the top of the file.

Inside this file, you'll see several blocks of code, wrapped in curly brackets, to organize the test logic:
- describe
    - This block groups together related tests. Everything inside it describes the feature or functionality you are testing
- beforeEach
    - This block contains code that runs before each individual test in the file. It's useful for setting up any preconditions or shared setup steps for your tests
- it
    - This block represents an individual test case. It contains the logic for a specific behavior you are testing, like "should add an item to the to-do list."
- context
    - This is similar to the describe block, but it's used to describe specific conditions under which the tests are running (e.g., "when the user is logged in" or "when the page is loaded").

## Additional Commonly Used Hooks
`beforeEach` runs before each individual test, but there are also additional hooks for controlling test flows as well
- afterEach
    - Runs after each test, this can be useful for clearing data or reseting the state of the environment before the next test
- before
    - This is a bit different from beforeEach
    - Everything in `before` only runs once, before ALL tests are run.
    - Runs once before all tests in a describe or context block. This can be useful for setup, like creating test data
- after
    - Similar to `before` this only runs once, after all the tests have been run in a describe or context block.
    - For example, this can be useful for cleanup tasks that should only happen once after all tests have run, such as closing sessions, deleting test data, or performing analytics

## Controlling Test Runs
During test development, you may want to control which tests are skipped, or maybe only run certain test cases. 

- only
    - This keyword tells Cypress to run only the specific test or block itâ€™s attached to, ignoring all other tests
    - To use this, add `.only` after the `it` or `describe` block
```
it.only('should add an item to the todo list', () => {
  cy.get('input').type('Buy Milk');
  cy.get('button').click();
  cy.get('ul').should('contain', 'Buy Milk');
});
```
- skip
    - This keyword tells Cypress to skip that test or block
    - To use this, add `.skip` after the `it` or `describe` block
```
it.skip('should not add an invalid item to the todo list', () => {
  cy.get('input').type('');
  cy.get('button').click();
  cy.get('ul').should('not.contain', '');
});
```
